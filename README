This is the replication package for our paper on semver-compliance for 0.y.z packages.

The notebooks in "notebooks/" require the dependencies specified in "requirements.txt" to be installed. 
They rely on data files in "data/". These data can be obtained by running the "convert.py" scripts in that folder.
The script requires data files from "data-raw/". These files can be generated by running "extract.py" in that folder.
This script requires the libraries.io data dump, as explained in the README file contained in this folder.

If you don't have these data, or if you don't want to download them, you can ask for the required data/*.csv.gz files by email.
