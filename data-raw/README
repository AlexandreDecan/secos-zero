This folder contains the raw data required to produce the content of the "data" folder. 

To populate this folder, first download snapshot 1.6.0 of libraries.io dataset that can be found on https://zenodo.org/record/2536573, extract versions.csv, dependencies.csv and projects_with_repository_fields.csv from this archive then run "python extract.py". 

This script will produce new files for each selected ecosystem: 
 - releases.csv.gz that contains the release informations;
 - dependencies.csv.gz that contains the dependency relationship informations;
 - repositories.csv.gz that contains data from github repositories for selected packages.
